KNOWN ISSUES:
- call method decloration does not have enough info to know if the object being called has the same name as some other object being used in the program, then the object, which may be imported from somewhere else may still be renamed the same name as the declared object in the file
- random spacing and new line character input may add that into variables such as strings
